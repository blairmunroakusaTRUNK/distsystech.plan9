 Welcome to my general distributed systems technology space
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

. This is where I accumulate projects related to plan 9
. As something matures, I may migrate it somewhere more structured.
. There is a DUMP here for processing.
. There are some working logs and miscellany
. An idea will live in it's own directory,
	until it matures into its own repo, or not.
. A lot of this has to do with my briefcase cluster computer
